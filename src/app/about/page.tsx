								<br /> To let them wander freely as glowing memories among the stars..
								<br /> This project isn&apos;t only code and maths.. it was born from inside my soul.. it&apos;s about peace, introspection and finding beauty and silence and calm..

								Thanks to the stars that inspired me, to the silence that gave me space, to the people who believed in me, the ones I love, and helped me. Thanks my dear Meily ‚ù§Ô∏èüåå<br />
								Gaze into the night and discover ancient stories written in starlight. <br />
								Each constellation whispers secrets of time, and every star burns and echo the dreams of those who once looked up... God bless, you. ‚ù§Ô∏è
